I am a PhD in Hybrid Intelligence at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (Knowledge In AI group). My research focus is on KKR (combining Argumentation as a subfield of KKR with logical reasoning) to enable their capacity in reasoning and explainability and use these approaches to address real-world problems.
