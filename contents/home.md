I am a PhD in Hybrid Intelligence at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (Knowledge in AI group). My research focuses on KKR (combining Logical Reasoning with Argumentation as a subfield of KKR) to enable their capacity in reasoning and explainability, and use these approaches to address real-world problems.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Knowledge in group at VU (2018 -2021) and in the Reinforcement Learning group at Leiden University (2021-2022). I did my PhD in Germany, University of Mannheim (2014-2017), and obtained my masters degree in Computational Logic from TU-Wien (Austria) and TU-Dresden (Germany)in 2012. Having a diverse research background, I made research visits to several institutions, including University of Bozen-Bolzano, University of Amsterdam, University of Calabria and University of Oxford.
