I am a PhD in Hybrid Intelligence at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (Knowledge In AI group). My research focuses on KKR (combining Logical reasoning with Argumentation as a subfield of KKR) to enable their capacity in reasoning and explainability and use these approaches to address real-world problems.
