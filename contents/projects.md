**Knowledge Representation Formalisms for Hybrid Intelligence**

(*Keywords: Inconsistency, Argumentation, Dialogical Explanation*)

This project is a part of the Hybrid Intelligence project with a collaboration of top AI researchers from the VU Amsterdam, the University of Amsterdam, the TU Delft, and the Universities of Groningen, Leiden, and Utrecht.
You can find more information about it [here](https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl/). 

In this project, we study a new KR formalism for modelling and reasoning inconsistent/prioritised knowledge bases (KBs) in Hybrid Intelligence scenarios. 
The novel formalism exhibits several benefits, notably providing dialogical explanations for logical reasoning in inconsistent KBs.
We also evaluate the framework on large-scale real-world datasets by implementing a [Darg system](https://github.com/Loanho314/SAF-Argumentation)

**OWL2DB**

(*Keywords: UML, Relational Database, OWL2*)

This project proposed an algorithm to transfer from OWL2 to Relational databases, and provided a tool [OWL2DB](
