**Knowledge Representation Formalisms for Hybrid Intelligence**

This project is a part of the Hybrid Intelligence project with a collaboration of top AI researchers from the VU Amsterdam, the University of Amsterdam, the TU Delft, and the Universities of Groningen, Leiden, and Utrecht.
You can find more information about it [here](https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl/). 

In this project, we study a new KR formalism in the context of inconsistent knowledge bases (KBs). 
The novel formalism exhibits several benefits, notably providing dialogical explanations for logical reasoning in inconsistent KBs.
We also implement and evaluate it on large-scale real-world datasets by using our [Darg system](https://github.com/Loanho314/SAF-Argumentation)
